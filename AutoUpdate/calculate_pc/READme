1. Create GO_category.txt file

GO_CATEGORY table
--------------------------------------------------------
create table GO_CATEGORY as select id,acc,'f'as category from term where term_type='molecular_function' and acc like 'GO%';
insert into GO_CATEGORY select id,acc,'p' from term where term_type='biological_process' and acc like 'GO%';
insert into GO_CATEGORY select id,acc,'c' from term where term_type='cellular_component' and acc like 'GO%';

now do select * from GO_CATEGORY into outfile '/tmp/GO_category.txt';
(you might need to reformat this GO_category.txt file to make it into the same format as "GO_201401_category.txt")

2. Query to GO database in mysql 

SELECT DISTINCT         
ancestor.acc, term.acc  
FROM    term   
INNER JOIN graph_path ON (term.id=graph_path.term2_id)   
INNER JOIN term AS ancestor ON (ancestor.id=graph_path.term1_id)  
WHERE term.acc LIKE 'GO:%' AND ancestor.acc LIKE 'GO:%' 
INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/GO_ALL.txt';

Now split this GO_ALL.txt file into 3 categories-
 
GO_BPO.txt
GO_CCO.txt
GO_MFO.txt
(use the GO_category.txt file created in step 1)

3. Copy the current version of uniprot_sprot.dat into this directory.

4. perl getAncestors.pl
It will create 3 files
BPparents.txt
MFparents.txt
CCparents.txt

5. perl getChildren.pl
It will create 3 files
BPchildren.txt
MFchildren.txt
CCchildren.txt

Now follow four steps to compute Combined_pc.txt - 

6. perl 1_go_freq.pl
7. perl 2_calc_freq_ancestorProp.pl
8. perl 3_root_anno.pl
9. perl 4 _calc_pc.pl

finally output will be Combined_pc.txt. Ignore intermediate files.
